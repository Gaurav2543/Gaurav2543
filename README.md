### üåÑ Beyond the Code

Adventurer at heart‚Äîriver jumping, mountain summits, late-night road trips. I believe that discipline from sport, humility from travel, and the focus from adventure sports shape my research: making me more creative, resilient, and collaborative.

> ‚ÄúThe most profound discoveries aren‚Äôt just in data, but in experience.‚Äù
